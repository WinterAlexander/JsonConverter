If you want to use JsonConverter as an API, 
put JsonConverterAPI.jar into the plugins 
folder of your server and inculde it into 
your build path.

If you want, you can simply include the 
source code of this archive into your source 
folder to use it without putting 
JsonConverterAPI.jar in the plugin folder.

Finally, if you want to use the console 
version, extract start_script.bat and 
JsonConverterConsole.jar of this archive 
and put them in the same folder. You'll just
have to double click start_scipt.bat to run
the program.
